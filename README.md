_FreeDPM is a project that aims to create a standalone, open-source replacement of the "Denpa Men, The" Series's games, so that its charm may be felt on modern platforms. It started in 2018 along side [Project-Hope](https://envyniv.github.io/Project-Hope) as denparpg, but stagnated until 2022;_

_Its previous names were: denparpg, Open Denpa and, in conclusion, FreeDPM_

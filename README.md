## _FreeDPM is a project that aims to create a standalone, open-source replacement of the "Denpa Men, The" Series's games, so that its charm may be felt on modern platforms. Development was rebooted in 2022._

### _Another, secondary objective is compatibility with the original, proprietary games (mainly QR Code stuff and Generation)_
